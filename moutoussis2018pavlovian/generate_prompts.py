Each stimulus is associated with two possible outcomes, and your reward depends on whether you decide to press the button or not.
For two of the stimuli, choosing correctly (press or no press) increases your reward by £1 with 0.8 probability and does not increase it with 0.2 probability. Choosing incorrectly increases your reward by £1 with 0.2 probability and does not increase it with 0.8 probability.
For the other two stimuli, choosing correctly (press or no press) does not increase your reward with 0.8 probability and decreases your reward by £1 with 0.2 probability. Choosing incorrectly does not increase your reward with 0.2 probability and decreases your reward by £1 with 0.8 probability.
You do not know which stimuli are associated with which outcomes.
You are playng for real money. Excellent performance could be worth up to £5 in additional earnings. Random performance will not be rewarded with additional earnings.
