This is because all thoughts, no matter their validity, are just thoughts, not facts.\n We would like your help in making people understand and use this strategy. We will now try to explain this strategy to you. We hope it makes sense. What we need your help with is to come up with a better explanation that would help others really understand it better than from our own explanations. Please think carefully about your answers.

    "One idea for people to detach from their worries is to get them to see their thoughts as just passing mental events rather than facts. What could we say to people who worry in the game to help them see their worries as just passing thoughts? Just telling people to do this doesn't work so well, so we need some more intuitive explanation of why this would be helpful. ",

To select a square you provide its location like [x_index, y_index]. Once you select a square, you will be told the number of fish you caught in that square.\n" \

    "You can select the same square several times. Each time you will get a similar number of fish.\n" \
    "However, there is a dangerous creature called the Kraken lurking in the ocean somewhere, which feeds on fish. You must avoid finding the Kraken. If you do, it will steal all the fish you have collected in that round! When the kraken is nearby, you will be told so in the begginning of the round. Sometimes the kraken will be somewhere else, and you won't be at risk of finding it. \n" \
    "Areas where the Kraken lurks will have very few fish as it has started to eat them. When the kraken is nearby, if you find a square with 50 fish or fewer, there is a 100 percent chance that the Kraken will be there. If you find a square with more than 50 fish, you'll always be safe. \n" \
