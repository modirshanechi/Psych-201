Each subsequent interaction will be comprised of an entirely new partner. 
In other words, you will NEVER interact with the same person more than once during this study. 

During each interaction, both you and your partner will be given $1 and asked to make a decision of how much to contribute to the common pool. 
In other words, each player is deciding how much of their $1 to keep for themselves or give to the group. 

IMPORTANT: You and your partner each can split the $1 in any amount as long as it is in $0.10 increments.

Importantly, in each round, all money contributed to the common pool will be multiplied by 1.5x (one and one half).

After all money contributed to the common pool is multipled by 1.5x, this larger sum will be divided equally among you and your partner.

The amount of money that each player receives on each round is thus determined by BOTH people.

You will be shown how much money your partner contributed to the common pool. You will then be asked to decide how much money to contribute to the common pool.
