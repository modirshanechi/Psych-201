# Instructions

Welcome! In this experiment we will ask you to make some simple decisions about restaurants.

You will receive a number of points for each decision. Your goal is to get as many points in total as you can.

You will receive a bonus based on your final total number of points.


# Restaurants in a New City

Imagine that you are going to be living for some period of time in a city in a foreign country.

Every restaurant in the city has a quality rating that is randomly distributed, with the average restaurant rating being 50. It is possible (though rare) that two restaurants could have the exact same rating.

Important: You don't learn the quality of a restaurant until you visit it for the first time! The restaurant's quality will not change, however, if you decide to revisit it.


# Deciding Where to Eat

Each night during your time in this city, you have a choice for where to go out to dinner.

You can decide to try a new restaurant (which will reveal its rating), or you can decide to go back any of the restaurants you've eaten at previously (which will always award the same number of points as before).

Please press ENTER key to continue.


# Number of Dinners and Bonus Payment

At the start of the experiment, we provide you a total of {total_nights} dinners. (The number of dinners remaining will be displayed.)

Your goal is to get as many total points as you can after eating all {total_nights} dinners.

You will receive a cash bonus after the completion of the experiment according to your final total score. Visiting restaurants at random will produce an average score of (50 points × {total_nights} dinners) = {bonus_threshold} points in total, so you will receive 1¢ for every {1/(bonus_rate * 100)} points over {bonus_threshold}. For instance, if your total is {70 * total_nights} points, you will receive ${compute_bonus(70 * total_nights)}. If your total is {90 * total_nights} points, you will receive ${compute_bonus(90 * total_nights)}.


# Sample Ratings

You will now see the sample ratings of the restaurants in three different nearby cities, to give you an idea of what sorts of ratings you can expect.

Here are the ratings from the restaurants in the first city:
{samples[0]}

Here are the ratings from the restaurants in the second city:
{samples[1]}

Here are the ratings from the restaurants in the third city:
{samples[2]}

Now the experiment will begin.


# Experiment

On each night, you will be asked to make a decision about where to eat. You can either choose to "Explore" (press {explore_button}) a new restaurant or "Exploit" (press {exploit_button}) by returning to the best of the restaurants you've already eaten at. You will be asked to make this decision for each of the {total_nights} dinners.
