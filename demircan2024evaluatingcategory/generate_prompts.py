Unfortunately, it has been a while since we hung out with Julty and Folty, and we cannot remember what they like and do not like.
However, we remember that whatever Julty likes, Folty does not like; and whatever Folty likes, Julty does not like.
We will present you with 120 images, one by one. After receiving each image you need to deliver it to either Julty or to Folty.
You can give the image to Julty using the button {left_key}, and to Folty using the button {right_key}.
Once you deliver an image, they tell us whether they enjoyed their image or not. We will pass on the feedback to you.
Hopefully, you can figure out over time which images are more suited for whom.\n"""
