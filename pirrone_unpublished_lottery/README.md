Unpublished data and no pre-print ready yet. This was a decision-making study using a classical experiment with choices between lotteries. The lottery on the left and the lottery on the right triggered one of two outcomes selected at random.  Specifically, the lottery on the left resulted in either outcome x0 or x1 (selected at random), while the lottery on the right resulted in either outcome x2 or x3 (selected at random).
