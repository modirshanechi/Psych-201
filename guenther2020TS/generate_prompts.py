    For example, airport has a sensible interpretation, while saddleolive would be considered nonsensical by most persons. Please rely on your own intuition while making these judgements; there are no definitive correct or wrong answers. \n
    However, we sincerely want to ask you to be as diligent as possible in making these judgements. For our study, we cannot analyse data only consisting of random answers. \n
    You will see these words one after another. If you feel that a word has a sensible interpretation, press the {choices[0]} key on your keyboard. If you feel that a word does not make sense, press the {choices[1]} key. You are free to write these button assignments down if it helps you remembering them. \n
    The study will not continue unless you give a response. Thus, if you want to pause the study, you can delay your response until you want to continue. \n
    By pressing the ESC key, you will end the fullscreen mode. This does not hinder you from continuing the experiment, but you cannot switch back to fullscreen mode. If possible, we want to ask you to stay in fullscreen mode for the whole duration of the experiment. \n"""
