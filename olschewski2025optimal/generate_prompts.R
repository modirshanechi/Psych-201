Imagine you play this lottery for real money and the computer determines randomly which outcome you will get according to the stated probabilities. You can think of the probabilities as the number of balls with a given outcome in an urn of 100 balls. In case of Lottery A this means there are 40 balls with a win of £50 and 60 balls with a win of £30 in the urn. You will be shown two lotteries side by side, and you should say which of the two you would prefer to play. There are no right or wrong choices, your task is just to indicate which lottery is more attractive to you personally. There will be 2 different types of blocks that we will explain immediately before each block.\n"

There are up to 40 lottery pairs and you can make decisions until your time is up. In the Time-Limit Block, it is very likely that you cannot process all available lotteries until the time runs up. Thus, there is a trade-off between the careful selection of the preferred lottery in a given trial and the number of trials you can finish in the given time. If you go too slow, you will not have the chance to choose your preferred lottery in later trials. If you go too fast, you might choose by accident a lottery that you do not really prefer.")

At the end of the experiment the computer will select randomly one trial out of all blocks that will determine which lottery you will play for real money. There are two possible cases: If for the selected trial you made a choice, the computer will play out the lottery that you chose. In this case, if you chose carefully you get your preferred lottery played out. If for the selected trial you did not make a choice due to the time limit, the computer will play out one of the two lotteries randomly. So in this case, you may get a worse gamble played out than you would have chosen. Finally, a random draw of the computer according to the stated probabilities will determine which real monetary bonus you will get from the lottery you play. All outcomes are presented in Experimental Pounds. The exchange rate for your bonus is 20 Experimental £ are 1 real British £. So, a lottery that states a win of Experimental £80 could result in an additional payment for you of £4.\n")
